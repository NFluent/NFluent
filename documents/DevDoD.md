NFluent Definition of Done (DoD) for Development
==================================

These are the rules that should be followed in order to contribute to this project:

1. Apache 2.0 License header is set on every source code file (but not mandatory for unit test files)
1. **Changes must have been captured in a github issue** for fix and new features
1. No warning during the build (warn as error)
1. 100% of test coverage for the NFluent project
	+ Test names should be clear enough to know what is in stakes here (this is why I disable the "ElementsMustBeDocumented" StyleCop rule for tests)
1. With (of course) all unit tests passed ;-)
1. The entire build (i.e. including all the unit tests execution) takes less than 10 minutes
1. Make sure the build script runs flawlessly. You can use **ci.cmd** to try it. This will build and tests NFluent for all supported Net Framework versions.
1. The build script generates a coverage report in the **CoverageReport** folder. You should check it to verify for 100* coverage


And there are rules and advices too on __[how to extend NFluent with your own methods](./HowToAddANewAssertion.md)__.
